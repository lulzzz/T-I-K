Consul requires up to 5 different ports to work properly, some on TCP, UDP, or both protocols. Below we document the requirements for each port.

* Server RPC (Default 8300). This is used by servers to handle incoming requests from other agents. TCP only.
* Serf LAN (Default 8301). This is used to handle gossip in the LAN. Required by all agents. TCP and UDP.
* Serf WAN (Default 8302). This is used by servers to gossip over the WAN to other servers. TCP and UDP.
* CLI RPC (Default 8400). This is used by all agents to handle RPC from the CLI. TCP only.
* HTTP API (Default 8500). This is used by clients to talk to the HTTP API. TCP only.
* DNS Interface (Default 8600). Used to resolve DNS queries. TCP and UDP.
